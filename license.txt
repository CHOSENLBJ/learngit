For all the time that you rain on my parade...
And all the club you get in using my name...
You think you broke my heart oh god for goodness sake...
You think i'm crying on my own well i ain't...

And i didn't wanna write a song...
Cause i didn't want anyone thinking i still care...
I don't...
But...
You still hit my phone up...

And baby i'll be moving on...
And i think you should be something i don't wanna hold back...
